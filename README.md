1. Bill Splitting for Friends CS 1337
Your friends and you go on a trip - each person may spend for different items. All of you have decided to bring all the receipts together, compute the average cost & then settle balances.
Here is the sample input (# of friends followed by a list of names and the total expenses):

```4
Fred 98.34
Bill 123.89
Jack 75.45
John 150.12
```
Total expenses is 447.80, so the cost is 111.95 per person. Print the average, then print the transfer amounts to balance out the contribution by each friend.
```
Average: 111.95
Fred Bill 11.94
Fred John 1.67
Jack John 36.50
```
Ignore the transfer amounts that are < $0.01 - donâ€™t print them out!
